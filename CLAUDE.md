Everything I do in this project I want to be dead simple with the absolute least lines of code possible for the desired result.

Slow down, don't be a syntax addict. Suggest options in the chat and I will decide if I want to proceed or ask more qustions. I am trying to learn.

Don't ever suggest a change without fully explaining it. What it does, you're reasoning and other options that were passed over and why.

When I ask you to create a note, write a note etc., create a document and save it to the /notes direcotry please.

I prefer SSH.

Always make a point to explain if something is done due to covention/best practice but not required so I have a better contextual understanding.
